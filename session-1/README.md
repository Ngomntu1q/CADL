This first homework assignment is contained in the session-1 notebook file.  If you are unsure of how to use notebook, please first visit:

http://github.com/pkmital/CADL/session-0 

And follow the instructions on getting notebook running.

Then come back here and view the `session-1.ipynb`.  This will guide you through working with a small dataset of images.  For Part 1, you'll need to find 100 images and use the function I've provided to create a montage of your images, saving it to the file "dataset.png" (template code provided below).  You can load an existing dataset of images, find your own images, or perhaps create your own images using a creative process such as painting, photography, or something along those lines.  Each image will be reshaped to 100 x 100 pixels.  There needs to be at least 100 images.  For Parts 2 and 3, you'll then calculate the mean and deviation of it using a tensorflow session.  For Part 4, you'll need to sort the entire dataset based on its color values or find another method of sorting them.  Finally, the last part will package everything for you in a zip file which you can upload to Kadenze to get assessed (only if you are a Kadenze Premium member, $10 p/m, free for the first month).  Then remember to complete the remaining parts of Assignemnt 1 on Kadenze!:

    * Participation Assessment: Comment on another student's open-ended arrangement (Part 4).  Think about what images they've used in their dataset and how the arrangement reflects what could be represented by that data.
    * (Extra Credit): Forum Post - Find artists making use of machine learning to organize data or finding representations within large datasets.

If you have any questions, be sure to enroll in the course and ask your peers in the \#CADL community or me on the forums!
