    "This first homework assignment will guide you through working with a small dataset of images.  For Part 1, you'll need to find 100 images and use the function I've provided to create a montage of your images, saving it to the file \"dataset.png\" (template code provided below).  You can load an existing dataset of images, find your own images, or perhaps create your own images using a creative process such as painting, photography, or something along those lines.  Each image will be reshaped to 100 x 100 pixels.  There needs to be at least 100 images.  For Parts 2 and 3, you'll then calculate the mean and deviation of it using a tensorflow session.  For Part 4, you'll need to sort the entire dataset based on its color values or find another method of sorting them.  Finally, the last part will package everything for you in a zip file which you can upload to Kadenze to get assessed (only if you are a Kadenze Premium member, $10 p/m, free for the first month).  Remember to complete the additional excercises online, including the Gallery participation and the Forum post.

Try to think about creating a set of images that represents something.  For instance, this might be images of yourself over time.  Or it might be every picture you've ever taken of your cat.  Or perhaps the view from your room at different times of the day.  Consider making the changes within each image as significant as possible.

If your mean image looks a lot like something recognizable, it's a good sign that there is a lot of predictability in your dataset.  If your mean image looks like nothing at all, a gray blob where not much seems to stand out, then it's pretty likely that there isn't very much in common between your images.  Neither is a bad scenario.  Though, it is more likely that having some predictability in your mean image, e.g. something recognizable, that there are representations worth exploring with deeper networks capable of representing them.

This will be a little more involved as there is no operation in tensorflow to do this for you.  However, you can do this by calculating the mean image of your dataset as a 4-D array.  To do this, you could write e.g.  `mean_img_4d = tf.reduce_mean(images, reduction_indices=0, keep_dims=True)` to give you a `1 x H x W x C` dimension array calculated on the `N x H x W x C` images variable.  The reduction_indices parameter is saying to keep the 0th dimension.  This way, you can write `images - mean_img_4d` to give you a `N x H x W x C` dimension variable, with every image in your images array having been subtracted by the `mean_img_4d`.
