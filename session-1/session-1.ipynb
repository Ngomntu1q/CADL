    "This first homework assignment will guide you through working with a small dataset of images.  For Part 1, you'll need to find 100 images and use the function I've provided to create a montage of your images, saving it to the file \"dataset.png\" (template code provided below).  You can load an existing dataset of images, find your own images, or perhaps create your own images using a creative process such as painting, photography, or something along those lines.  Each image will be reshaped to 100 x 100 pixels.  There needs to be at least 100 images.  For Parts 2 and 3, you'll then calculate the mean and deviation of it using a tensorflow session.  For Part 4, you'll need to sort the entire dataset based on its color values or find another method of sorting them.  Finally, the last part will package everything for you in a zip file which you can upload to Kadenze to get assessed (only if you are a Kadenze Premium member, $10 p/m, free for the first month).  Remember to complete the additional excercises online, including the Gallery participation and the Forum post.  If you have any questions, be sure to enroll in the course and ask your peers in the \\#CADL community or me on the forums!\n",

    "Now use tensorflow to calculate the standard deviation and upload the standard deviation image averaged across color channels as a \"jet\" heatmap of the 100 images.  This will be a little more involved as there is no operation in tensorflow to do this for you.  However, you can do this by calculating the mean image of your dataset as a 4-D array.  To do this, you could write e.g.  `mean_img = tf.reduce_mean(images, reduction_indices=0, keep_dims=True)` to give you a `1 x H x W x C` dimension array calculated on the `N x H x W x C` images variable.  The reduction_indices parameter is saying to keep the 0th dimension.  This way, you can write `images - mean_img` to give you a `N x H x W x C` dimension variable, with every image in your images array having been subtracted by the `mean_img`.  If you calculate the square root of the sum of the squared differences of this resulting operation, you have your standard deviation!\n",
